pam_power
pluggable authentication module powering off when effortlessly requested
by Jacob Appelbaum <jacob@appelbaum.net>

This is a very simple PAM module that looks for a special password and halts
the machine. It is intentionally quite simple and anything more complex should
be done with the much more extensible PAM module pam_confused:

  https://code.google.com/p/confused/source/browse/trunk/pam_confused/readme.txt

To use pam_power, we suggest adding one line to the top of
/etc/pam.d/common-auth:

  auth optional pam_exec.so quiet expose_authtok /sbin/pam_power

Once installed - /sbin/pam_power will be called for every PAM authentication;
any user may power down the machine from any PAM enabled program.

Thanks to grawity and others for their suggestions.
